## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Steps

- Sketch the design to prepare the different components ![](./images/sketch.png)

- Set up the repository, live site and starter files
- created a sketch of the different components I will be needing ![](./images/nft_sketch.png)
- translated sketch into HTML
- added the class in CSS
- added relevant styling
- adding hovering styles
- fixing mobile responsiveness

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

How to add an image as a part of the background

```css
body {
  background-image: url(../images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100% auto;
}
```

### Continued development

What I would love to learn more about is:

- a more efficient way of making things responsive to mobile screens instead of targetting each element and changing the spaces and sizes.

- I couldn't figure out how to get the right spacing for the plan class in the mobile format (screen 375 px)
